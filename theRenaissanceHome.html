		<p class = "infoparagraph">The Renaissance was a period of European cultural&sbquo; economic&sbquo; political and artist &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo;. Taking place from the 14th to 17th century&sbquo; the Renaissance
		fueled the rediscovery of classical philosophy&sbquo; literature and art. Credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and Modern-Day Civilization&sbquo; the Renaissance

		<h2 class = "infoheading">Humanism</h2>
		<img src = "Images/humanismimg1.jpg" alt = "The painting Virtue Triumphant over Vice by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna" id = "Humanism">
		<p class = "infoparagraph">Although the essence of the Renaissance was manifested through various forms&sbquo; one of the first was Humanism. Humanism was a cultural movement that first appeared near the 
		beginning of the Renaissance. Humanism was put into action by secular men of letters rather than by the scholar-clerics who had taken over intellectual life during the <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages">Medieval times</a>
		and created the <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scholasticism">Scholastic philosophy</a>. Humanism was first established and initiated in Italy&sbquo; and predecessors of the movement include men like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch">Pretrarch</a>&sbquo; while 
		its chief protagonists included <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannozzo_Manetti">Giannozzo Manetti</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Bruni">Leonardo Bruni</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsilio_Ficino">Marsilio Ficino</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola">Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</a>&sbquo; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla">Lorenzo Valla</a>&sbquo; and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coluccio_Salutati">Coluccio Salutati</a>. Now&sbquo; let&rsquo;s look at what 
		humanism actually is. Humanism had several features&sbquo; one of which being that it took human nature in all it's various manifestations and achievements as it&rsquo; subject. The 
		second one was that it put emphasis on the unity and truth found in philosophical and theological schools and systems (a belief called <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/topic/religious-syncretism">syncretism</a>). Lastly&sbquo; it looked forward to a rebirth 
		in human spirit and wisdom. To summarize&sbquo; the desired effect of humanism was to help men break free from restrictions imposed by religious orthodoxies&sbquo; to inspire free inquiry
		and critique&sbquo;and to put more confidence into the possibilities of human thoughts and creations. Humanism and the Renaissance it enveloped spread North from Italy to all parts of Europe&sbquo;
		as printing had recently been created&sbquo; which allowed availability to classical texts increase tenfold. However&sbquo; by the end of the 16th century&sbquo; the battle of <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Reformation">Reformation</a>
		and <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> had taken majority of Europe&sbquo; while intellectual life was put on the brink of <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history">Enlightenment.</a></p>

		<h2 class = "infoheading">The Medeci Family</h2>
		<img src = "Images/medicifamily.jpg" alt = "This is an image of the Medici family" id = "mediciFamily">
		<p class = "infoparagraph">The Renaissance began in Florence&sbquo; Italy&sbquo; a place with rich cultural history&sbquo; and wealthy citizens were able to help flourishing artists. One particularly notable wealthy family was the 
		Medici Family. The Medici Family ruled Florence for 60 years&sbquo; and were great bakers of the Renaissance movement. Credited by great Italian writers&sbquo; artists&sbquo; politicians and others for participating in
		an intellectual and artistic revolution which would be much different than what they experienced during the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)">Dark Ages</a>. The movement first spread to to other Italian city-states&sbquo; including Venice&sbquo; 
		Milan&sbquo; Bologna&sbquo; Ferreira and Rome. Then&sbquo; during the 15th century&sbquo; Renaissance ideas spread from Italy to France and then throughout western and northern Europe. Although other European countries
		experienced their Renaissance later than Italy&sbquo; the impacts were still revolutionary and undoubtedly fueled by the powerful Medici family who assisted in the expansion of the movement from the very beginning.</p>
		<h2 class = "infoheading">Advancements Made During the Renaissance</h2>
		
		<!-- This is the "Advancements made during the Renaissance" section -->
		<p class = "infoparagraph">As foreshadowed earlier&sbquo; many scientific&sbquo; architectural and artist advancements were made during the Renaissance. Here&sbquo; we'll be discussing a few significant ones. Before we list advancements
		made in different fields&sbquo; it&rsquo;s important to note that science&sbquo; art and architecture were very closely related during the Renaissance. All three fields went hand-in-hand with one another&sbquo; and discoveries
		in each were linked to work done in the other.</p>
		<ol class = "infoparagraph">
			<li class = "listitems">Art</li>
			<img src = "Images/vitruvianMan.jpg" alt = "Picture of Leonardo Da Vinci&sbquo;s Vitruvian Man" id = "VitMan">
			<p>Through increased scientific research and discovery&sbquo; artists such as Leonardo Da Vinci were able to incorporate human anatomy into their artwork&sbquo; to replicate and assist scientists with their research. 
			Art was closely intertwined with science through creating visual models of discoveries that scientists had made surrounding astronomy and anatomy particularly. It&rsquo;s also important to note that art and artistic perspectives 
			became generally more accepted and sought-after during the Renaissance&sbquo; which is an achievement in itself. Renaissance art was characterized by naturalism and realism. It aimed to portray objects and people as real 
			as possible&sbquo; which intertwined with research scientists were conducting at the time.</p>
			<li class = "listitems">Architecture</li>
			<img src = "Images/FilippoBrunelleschi.jpg" alt = "Statue of Filippo Brunelleschi" id = "FilBru">
			<p>Along with art&sbquo; advancements in the architectural realm were equally as revolutionary. Famous architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi studied mathematics to design impressive and at the time&sbquo; unprecedented 
			buildings&sbquo; such as buildings shaped as domes. Artistic and visual models of buildings also played a fundamental role in the advancement of architecture as it gave architects a visual base to build off&sbquo; rather 
			than only mathematics.</p>
			<li class = "listitems">Science</li>
			<img src = "Images/nicolasCopernicus.jpg" alt = "Drawing of Nicolas Copernicus" id = "NiCo">
			<p>Many revolutionary scientific ideas were discovered during the Renaissance&sbquo; however two of the most notable would be in the fields of astronomy and anatomy. In terms of astronomy&sbquo; Nicolas Copernicus proposed a theory stating that 
			Sun was the center of the solar system instead of the Earth&sbquo; which was the widely accepted theory until that point. Biology was also another field that faced great advancements during the Renaissance. Human anatomy became more well 
			studied&sbquo; and research about the human skeleton was conducted. Other notable scientists who provided a new view surrounding mathematics and astronomy include Galileo and Descartes. </p>

		<img src = "Images/counterReformation.jpg" alt = "Painting of the Catholic Church" id = "catholicChurch">
		<p class = "infoparagraph">It is widely believed by many scholars that the Renaissance ended due to a plethora of reasons. By the end of the 15th century&sbquo; the Italian peninsula was undergoing many wars. Spanish&sbquo; French and German invaders started to battle for Italian territories&sbquo; which caused a 
		of disruption and instability in the region. Additionally&sbquo; changing trade routes led to a period of economic decline&sbquo; which resulted in less money for wealthy contributers to spend on art. Later on&sbquo; a movement known as the Counter-Reformation&sbquo; the Catholic church
		began to censor artists and writers in response to the Protestant Reformation. As a result of this&sbquo; Renaissance artists &rdquo;toned down&ldquo; their artwork out of fear of being too bold. Moreover&sbquo; in 1545&sbquo; the Council of Trent established the Roman Inquisition&sbquo;
		which made humanism and any other views that went against the Catholic church an act of heresy punishable by death. Due to all these factors combined&sbquo; historians believe that by the early 17th century&sbquo; the Renaissance movement had died out&sbquo; which gave way to the Age
		of Enlightenment.</p>
